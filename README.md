### Hi there, I'm SidðŸ‘‹ 

## I'm a first-year graduate student from Rice University.

I chose to major in computer science because it affords me the 
opportunity to explore my passion for solving problems with my hand. 
I love to engage in this end-to-end experience which is fulfilling to me
because I get to not only brings up an idea but also
bring it to fruition.
